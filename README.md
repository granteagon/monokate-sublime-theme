monokate-sublime-theme
======================

Monokai like theme for Sublime Text that is easy on the eyes, like Kate Upton.

## About

This theme was designed to highlight code, without stealing user focus.

- Comments are readable without being too hard to read, but do not have as much visual importance as actual code.
- Colors are muted to avoid being distracting.
- Excessive font styling is avoided
- Can be used in night or day without having to squint

Please Note:

- This theme was designed for use with Apple's Menlo typeface.  I have not tested other fonts.
- This theme was adapted from similar theme which include some untested styles.

## Contributions Welcome!

- Use similar color palette to original
- Don't abuse the reader (intense colors, and other distracting styles should be avoided)
- Please include a screenshot of editor with pull requests
